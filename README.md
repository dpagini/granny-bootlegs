This site was built by and maintained by me in the 1999-2002 timeframe as a place to house a list of my live DMB (and other) shows, for the purposes of trading. I was young, and certainly not entrenched in the web development community, hence the terrible (and embarassing) HTML.

###TODO
* update links in html to be case sensitive (github.io is case sensitive to filenames)
