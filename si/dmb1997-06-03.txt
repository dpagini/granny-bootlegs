Notes:
----------
*	The DAT initially had some "problems" that were edited.
	There was one channel that had higher levels, but the channel
	with the lower levels was not at a constant level.  The
	lower channel continually decreased over the entire length
	of the show.  The beginning of the show had a 3dB difference
	between the two channels, but by the end of the show, that
	difference grew to 13dB.  A graphic fade was done in Sound
	Forge to level out the low channel, then a boost was done
	to even out the levels between the right and left channel.
	The results are good, much better than the original.
*	There are problems throughout this show with clipping.
	The spots are very brief and the rest of the tape sounds
	good.  All of these problems are on the master.  I had two
	other sources (one DAT and one CD) and both did not sound
	as good as this source.  See below for details.
*	There was ~15 seconds worth of clipping at 2:28 in Minarets.
	The clipping was only in the right channel, so the left channel
	audio was inserted over this time period.
*	Dave does a Rod Stewart tease between Typical and DIDO,
	"Tonight's The Night".
*	There was 2 seconds of bad clipping at 3:58 in SMTS.  The clipping
	was only in the right channel, so the audio from the left
	channel was inserted.
*	There is a clip at 1:42 in Too Much, not edited.
*	There are clips at 1:40, 2:05, and 4:07 in Tripping Billies,
	only the clip at 4:07 was edited.
*	There are clips between 7:40 to 7:50 in Nancies.  These were
	not edited.  A clip at 7:55 and 8:05 in Nancies were edited,
	since the clips at those spots were only in the right channel.
	The audio from the left channel for 0.87 and 2.00, respecively,
	seconds at each spot was inserted.
