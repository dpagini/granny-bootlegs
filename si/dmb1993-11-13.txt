Notes:
________________________
-Jimi Thing & Seek Up were failed to be split on 
the master cd's, therefore I had to split them.

-At the beginning of d2t2, there is a tiny pop, 
as well the song starts a little late, with Dave 
doing the guitar intro.

-Also, d2t8, it starts out with Dave strumming the 
notes to Watchtower, then Dave stops and Dave & 
Boyd say goodbye.





DAVE'S NOTES:

basically, I wanted a source of this show that a) was the full show, 
and b) had the unknown soundchecked song
I found two different 'sources' of the show (both sbd) - 
	copy 1 had the soundchecked song, but was missing both Granny and Help Myself
	copy 2 had all the correct songs, but didn't have the unknown soundchecked song

so I decided to merge both copies of this show to make a full copy for myself
I made this info file so people can see what version of this show I have
if they want a copy.  This is in no ways an attempt to undermind the two people
that put the other copies together, only my attempt to enjoy as much of DMB as
I can.  I again just want to get the best of this show and I hope nobody has any
problems with this.
