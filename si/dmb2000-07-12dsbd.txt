DAT>CD: Unknown
CD>SHN Conversion: Bonnie and Clyde - 2.1.02

Conversion Notes - With the recent resurgance of a pathetic few
who believe certian shows are only for specific people, Bonnie and I
are going to be releasing these supposed "rarities" to everyone; as
music from DMB always should be - available to all.  The DMB has always
encouraged the open trading of their shows, and in the opinion of this
author, would be sickened to see the actions of a few (who seem to 
never actually listen to the music that DMB plays, but otherwise gain a
false sense of admiration from others).

Enjoy the show...everyone!
