Additional Notes (by Don Becker)

Notice that there are fade-outs after each song.  If the source info above is
correct, then technically there should not be any fade-outs, right?  A well
established trader also informed me that he once heard 99x's rebroadcast of this
show and noted that he remembered a lot more speaking between tracks.  Obviously
there has been some track editing done to this show.  If anyone else has more
information or suggestions about the source of this show, please email me at
donald.becker@marquette.edu

Thanks
