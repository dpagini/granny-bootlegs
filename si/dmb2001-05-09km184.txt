Notes:
----------
It rained lightly during Soulive's set and it had stopped and cleared
a bit so I decided to just fly the mics with only some tape around the
connections and windscreens. Bad move because it started to rain again
during Satellite and got bad enough that I had to lower the stand and
clamp on an umbrella. Then it proceeded to rain steadily up until True
Reflections, but it's not really noticeable, I don't think. Only some
thumping, etc when I moved the stand up and down after #41. This was
the loudest PA I've ever heard at a DMB show, especially Carter's toms
and snare.  I was in pain by the time Two Step came around, I don't
think the recording captures the explosiveness of Carter's drums fully
but it came out well. Anyway for the full effect stand under your lawn
sprinkler and enjoy. =)
