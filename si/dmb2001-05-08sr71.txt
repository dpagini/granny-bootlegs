Notes:
----------
*	During "What Would You Say?" I accidentally bumped the left channel knob on the
	ad500.  The level was red hot for about a minute during the solos at the end.  I
	fixed it as best as I could in Cool Edit.

*	Special thanks to Scott McPherrin for the ad500 and Dan Troy for his D8.
