very solid recording.  the mid-highs are not as thin as they are in the previous night's recording, but the overal dynamics and s/n seems a tad bit lower.  it doesn't have an overly "airy" feeling you get in some of the huge venues they play in now, and there is so little crowd noise you have to wonder if it's a board at times, except for the thin-ness.
