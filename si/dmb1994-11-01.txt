NOTES:
----------

The band played one long set with no encore as they had limited time.  Dave said something about a disco party happening after they were done.  They were gonna stick around, put on some tight clothes, and get their thang on...

There are a few split second diginoise zaps in Seek Up.
There are a few split second diginoise in Dancing Nancies.
There are a few split second diginoise zaps in Warehouse.
There is a split second drop between Warehouse and BOWA along with some level adjusting at the beginning of BOWA, but the diginoise stops for the rest of the show  :o)
There is a split second drop between PFWYG and Jimi Thing.
There is a 7 second dropout in #36 ~7:00 into the track.
