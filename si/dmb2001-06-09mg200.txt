Notes: 
----------
*	I ran the stand very low at the requeest of the video folk who were 
	shooting from directly behind my seats.  The stand began at roughly 
	6 feet and I was able to creep up to about 8 by the end of the show.  

*	Also note that there is another source fom my stand.  John Stansfield 
	ran KM140> Sonosax > AD2K+ > M1 from my stand.

*	This show will fit on two CDs if one is an 80 minute CD. 
	Just split after Two Step.
