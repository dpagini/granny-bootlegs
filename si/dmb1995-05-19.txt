very solid recording.  detail isn't really compromised in any one area, though the mid-highs seem a bit thin.  it doesn't have an overly "airy" feeling you get in some of the huge venues they play in now, and there is so little crowd noise you have to wonder if it's a board at times, except for the thin-ness.
