Notes:  
Some Static present throughout due to the fact that it is an ALD recording.
	
A few tracking mistakes...the converter isnt a huge DMB fan, so there are
a few minor tracking details:

d1t4 Lie in our Graves (cont.)- This is the ending to LIOG after the pause
d2t2 SMTS->ASTB->Too Much- Converter wasnt sure where each song ended and the next began.
d2t5 Jimi Thing (cont.)- The end of Jimi Thing was a bassy jam, and converter wasnt sure
     if it was another song
d2t6 WWYS-> Ants Marching- see d2t2

I dont have the time to redo the tracking, if someone wants to do it, and change the text,
then be my guest :)  I figure with only 20 people in the group and not widespread
distribution of this, its not a huge deal to change.
