# 	Trey on keys
## 	Last time Phish played just Landlady was 12/3/94 (ironically DMB opened that show)
###	Full bad with Trey and Tony acoustic. The crowd was yelling "Virginia loves you Trey," 
		and he said back "Thank you, i love virginia too, very cool place to play music. 
		Hey isn't that famous line, Virginia is for lovers?" (crowd went nuts). 
		Then trey said, I'm originally from Jersey, I don't know what to say, what comment would you say about that??" 
		Tony reminded him the Garden State, and Trey, apparently not clearly hearing 
		Tony responded, "the Garbage state?" he then said "New Jersey is for turn pikes i guess." 
#### 	Trey solo acoustic
% 	With Dave Matthews. Dave played guitar on Everyday and Three Little Birds. 
		For the last 2 songs Dave just stood at the mic and sang.
