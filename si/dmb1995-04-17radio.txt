Notes:
----------
*	The source of this show is not known.  It was found
	as filler on a DAT i was converting.  It sounds great
	but there could be an FM or analog generation in
	the history of the DAT.
*	The levels were a bit low, so i boosted them in
	SoundForge by 4dB.
*	There is some diginoise in the intro track.
*	There is some diginoise in the production notes track.
