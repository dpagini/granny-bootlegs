Editing:

Disc One, Tracks 01 - 08 were amplified by a factor of 2.5.  

Disc One, Track 08 - At some point near the end of this track, I amplified a
2-3 second gap of dead space by a factor of 5, and then faded that same gap
in from half volume to full volume, creating a decently smooth transition in
amplification factors from 2.5 to 5.

Disc One, Track 09 through the end of the show were amplfied by a factor of 5
(yes, a factor of 5).  This produced frequent clipping during the show, and I
do concede this, but the level of the Carter's drums relative to the band led
to his drums being the only instrument I heard that clipped, and that's how I
justified it to myself.


* - Dave Matthews Solo
^ - Weird problem with vocals switching from left to right channel, and back
    This problem would have been the soundman's problem, not the DATs.
$ - Slight dropout just eliminated by me.  Will appear as a slight skip.  Sorry.
& - Man, true reflections was a problem.  Two major dropouts, one around 1:50,
    the other around 2:35.  For the one at 2:30, I put in a line that had already
    been sung, and then sent it straight into boyd's solo.  Sounds a little weird,
    but much better than it did at first.  There was no salvaging the 1:50 dropout.
    I did my best, but it's still blatently obvious.  Ah well.  The third major
    problem was at 4:45.  I don't know what it was, but the song sort of skips a
    beat again.  I didn't touch this one.
! - Weird reverb thang going on at one point.  On master DAT.
