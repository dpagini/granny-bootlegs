Granny Bootleg Trading Rules

First of all, sorry about the txt file, but I am just too lazy to make
a page dedicated to my trading rules   ;-)


Dave's Rules:

1)	I only am looking to trade for DAO shows.  If you have a track at once
show, please be honest and tell me.  I may occasionally trade for a TAO show,
depending on what it is, and the quality.  My TAO shows can be easily converted
to DAO, so don't be shy about asking for them.  I can make them sound perfectly
smooth and you would never be able to tell it once had 2 second gaps.

2)	Please be honest about mp3 sourced shows, because I do not want them.
If I have a show you want, and I ask you for a show but it is mp3 sourced, please
just be honest and tell me.  I will b&p the show you want from me with no
questions asked.  If you have source info, I would really appreciate it.  I am
very honest about my source info, and if I wasn't sure about it, it specifically
says that in the txt file.

3)	Please tell me how you burn your shows.  You should use EAC (Exact Audio Copy)
to extract the .wav's to your HD and then burn them onto a disc.  If you burn disc->disc
this could cause pops and cause the copy to lose quality compared to the original.  If
you use EAC it creates an exact copy of the original track and reports any possible
'blemishes' in the track.  If you don't use EAC, you should check it out and try it, it
really does work nicely.

4)	The rest of my rules are basic trading rules.  I usually trade disc for disc
not show for show, although there are some exceptions.  I use standard bubble mailers
to mail my CD's and usually use either Sony or Memorex and if I am using different,
I will inform you.  If you are using generic CD's, please tell me also.

5)	TBA   :)   more rules to be announced as I trade more, although I think I
covered everything...

if you have any questions, email me
