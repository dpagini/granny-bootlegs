Granny Bootlegs Want List


This is my want list.  Basically, anything on my want list that you have I will
be more than willing to trade with you for it.  If you have something on my list
and would like to trade, drop me an email at patriots_84@hotmail.com or IM me at
dpagini84.  If you do have these shows, I prefer to trade with someone who has the
source info for the shows.  Thanks.







first off, most shows I don't have I probably will be semi-interested in acquiring

if you have a show that I have on this list, follow these steps to set up a trade:

1) email me with the subject 'wantlist trade xx-xx-xxxx' where the X's are the date
	of the show that you are offering to me
	1a) if you have more than one show, make the subject of the email just
		'wantlist trade' and list the shows you are offering in the body
2) include what show you want from me and the earliest date you can send
3) also, please include a sentence or some type of information of what CDs you use, weather
	you use EAC or not, and if burn DAO
4) sit back and wait, I usually get to trade requests within a day and I usually check
	my emails quite often
